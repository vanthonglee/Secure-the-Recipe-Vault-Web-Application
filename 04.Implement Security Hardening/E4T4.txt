# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF is a security measure that filters and monitors HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. It helps to protect against common web application attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). By implementing a WAF, you can detect and block malicious traffic before it reaches your web application instance.
