Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

S3
- S3 buckets should be encrypted at rest with AWS KMS keys [Medium]
- S3 bucket server access logging should be enabled [Medium]
- S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer [Medium]
- S3 buckets should be configured to use Object Lock [Medium]
- S3 buckets should have event notifications enabled [Medium]

EC2
- EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address [High]
- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP [High]
- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP [High]
- EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) [High]
- EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager [Medium]
- Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP [Medium]

IAM User
- MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have a console password
- MFA should be enabled for all IAM users
- iam-user-no-policies-check-conformance-pack-5rh4idhbl
- mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access-conformance-pack-5rh4idhbl

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:
- Enable MFA 
- S3: Enable encryption with AWS KMS
- S3: Enable version control, enable Object Lock
- EC2: should be placed in private subnet
- EC2: Should be only open for specifics ports
