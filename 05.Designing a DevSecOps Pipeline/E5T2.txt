# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- Checkove
- TFLint
- Terrafirma
- Accurics
- CloudSploit

### Example vulnerability

- Let's say you have an AWS CloudFormation template that provisions an Amazon S3 bucket with public read access. Checkov would scan the template and identify this as a potential security vulnerability. It would flag the bucket's access control configuration as non-compliant with security best practices.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

- Trivy
- Nessus
- Clair

### Example vulnerability

Trivy would provide details about the vulnerability, including the CVE identifier associated with it. For example, it might identify the vulnerability as CVE-2021-XXXX

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Config
- AWS Inspector
- AWS GuardDuty
- AWS Security Hub  

### Example vulnerability

- Let's say you have an Amazon EC2 instance that is missing critical security patches. Security Hub might detect this as a vulnerability and generate an alert. It would provide details about the specific instance, the missing patches, and the potential risks associated with the vulnerability.
